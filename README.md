# Movie Wolf

This is a rebuild and expansion of my earlier Movie Wolf project to force me to learn some React skills. In its MVP form, the purpose of this app is to track our household movie collection for more easy browsing than sifting through several drawers of sleeved Blu-Rays and DVDs. For more information on what our setup looks like (and for some tips on organizing your own physical media collection as each streaming platform fragments and more and more is lost) check out this write-up Sara did on it [here](https://yellowcardigan.tumblr.com/post/157871319152/dvd-organization-project). 

## The project has a few goals: 

1) Remind us what we have on hand when we're looking for something to watch -- the most simple version of this would be something like `Movie.all.sample`, but an ideal future state would be one where that `#sample` was checking against a scope of movies we've not recently watched, trying to algorithmically produce the happy surprise of remembering, "Oh we SHOULD watch Miami Vice (2006) again!"
2) Remind us what other movies we'd like to get for our collection -- for us, this tends to focus on a set of favorite directors, or directors we'll take time to work through when the mood overtakes us. One goal of the app, then, is to show us the movies our collection is missing from those directors and allow easy adding to our movie club wishlist. We're trying to create a situation where watching Miami Vice (2006) reminds us we should probably watch The Keep (1983) sometime, so why not add it to our collection before it goes out of print and is no longer available to stream anywhere due to the ruthless profit-driven logic that says it's not worth it to keep a licensing agreement for a movie only a couple of weirdos wanted to make time for.
3) Get me to finally learn both the idiosyncracies of Rails 5 and React.
